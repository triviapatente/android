## Getting started
This project was a fun pet project developed by us back in 2017. We managed to exhume the code and make it run again in order, but the technologies are quite old! Yet, cool.

### Prerequisites
The app dates to when Java was mainstream for Android development üòÑ:
||Version|
|:----- |:----- |
|Android|minSdkVersion: 16, targetSdkVersion: 30|

After that, the code should compile fine.
### Preparing the environment
In order to run the application properly, you need to deploy the [backend](https://github.com/triviapatente/backend) as well.

After you setup the backend, deploy it anywhere and modify this line in [strings.xml](https://github.com/triviapatente/android/blob/master/TriviaPatente/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml):
```
<string name="baseUrl">YOUR_BASE_URL_HERE/</string>
```
### Executing
Build the app with Android Studio and challenge your friends at who knows the driver licence theory better üòú.

## Contribute
We still need to set up an easy way to contribute, and provide a list of updates that might improve the project. You can save your ‚òïÔ∏ès until then or, you
can drop an [email](mailto:luigi.donadel@gmail.com) to help us:
+ Set up coding style guidelines
+ Wiki
+ Documentation
+ Set up contribution workflow

### Authors
This project was developed with ‚ù§Ô∏è and a giant dose of curiosity and passion from some very young folks (we were 20 at the time), in 2017 as a side project.
