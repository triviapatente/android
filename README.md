## Getting started
This project was a fun side hustle developed by us back in 2017. 

We recently recover the code and make it buildable again in order to showcase it in this repository.

This means obviously that it uses some old technologies, not the standard we are used to in 2023.

### Prerequisites
//TODO
||Version|
|:----- |:----- |

### Installing
//TODO

After that, the code should compile fine.
### Preparing the environment
In order to run the application properly, you need to deploy the backend behind it.
Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/triviapatente/backend)

After you setup the backend properly, deploy it anywhere and modify this line in [strings.xml](https://github.com/triviapatente/android/blob/master/TriviaPatente/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml):
```
<string name="baseUrl">YOUR_BASE_URL_HERE/</string>
```
### Executing
//TODO

## Contribute
We still need to set up an easy way to contribute, and provide a list of updates that might improve the project. You can save your ☕️s until then or, you
can drop an [email](mailto:luigi.donadel@gmail.com) to help us:
+ Set up coding style guidelines
+ Wiki
+ Documentation
+ Set up contribution workflow

### Authors
This project was developed with ❤️ and a giant dose of curiosity and passion from some very young folks (we were 20 at the time), in 2017 as a side project.
